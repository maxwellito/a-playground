# A-Playground

_My personal playground to experiment A-Frame_

This repo won't contain any production ready code, but just little demo of the fun I'm having with A-Frame. This will lead to something big, I hope.

- [Cyper-Navigator](https://maxwellito.github.io/a-playground/cyber-navigator/) like the infinite but with little windows to go through. No collision or points yet. Use the trigger of your right controller to accelerate and your headset vision to orientate.
- [Infinite](https://maxwellito.github.io/a-playground/infinite.html) an infinite colorful mesh passing below your face.
- [Cube](https://maxwellito.github.io/a-playground/cube.html) an inifinite cube that you navigate with your head. This was a test to use the headset orientation, but a damn bad choice, it highly unconfortable.

Good luck!'
