# A-Playground

_My personal playground to experiment A-Frame_

This repo won't contain any production ready code, but just little demo of the fun I'm having with A-Frame. This will lead to something big, I hope.

- [Asteroids](https://maxwellito.github.io/a-playground/asteroids/) Inifinite tunnel of asteroids. Use the grip of your right controller to accelerate and navigate. The right trigger change the color theme.
- [Color Vortex](https://maxwellito.github.io/a-playground/color-vortex/) Vortex of color spikes. Powered by GLSL to push the GPU limits. Use the (Left Grip / Key W) to change view. Use the (Left Trigger / Key Q) to change theme.
- [Cyper-Navigator](https://maxwellito.github.io/a-playground/cyber-navigator/) like the infinite but with little windows to go through. No collision or points yet. Use the trigger of your right controller to accelerate and your headset vision to orientate.
- [Infinite](https://maxwellito.github.io/a-playground/infinite.html) an infinite colorful mesh passing below your face.
- [Cube](https://maxwellito.github.io/a-playground/cube.html) an inifinite cube that you navigate with your head. This was a test to use the headset orientation, but a damn bad choice, it highly unconfortable.
